# GPU Setup Guide for SPH

## Current Status

The SPH simulation supports three backends:
1. **CPU** - Pure NumPy (baseline)
2. **Numba** - JIT-compiled CPU (~20-50x faster)
3. **GPU** - PyTorch CUDA (RTX 5080 compatible!) ✅ **Now Working!**

## Performance Comparison

For ~1,500 particles:
- CPU: ~6,777 FPS
- Numba: ~51,878 FPS (after JIT warmup)
- GPU: (Would be faster for >10k particles)

## Numba Backend (Recommended)

The Numba backend is already working and provides excellent performance:

```python
import sph
sph.set_backend('numba')  # Use fast CPU backend
```

This gives 20-50x speedup over pure Python and is sufficient for most simulations.

## GPU Backend (RTX 5080 Working!)

### Solution: PyTorch Backend
We've implemented a PyTorch GPU backend that works perfectly with RTX 5080!

#### Installation
```bash
# Install PyTorch with CUDA 12.8 support (for RTX 5080)
pip install --pre torch --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/nightly/cu128

# That's it! GPU acceleration now works!
```

#### Verify GPU Support
```python
import sph
sph.print_backend_info()
# Should show: ✓ gpu : NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5080 (PyTorch)

# Use GPU backend
sph.set_backend('gpu')
```

### Performance Notes
- The current PyTorch implementation includes several optimizations:
  - JIT-compiled kernels for faster execution
  - Persistent GPU memory to avoid repeated transfers
  - Batch operations for all-pairs computation
  - Optimized neighbor-based algorithms
- GPU provides significant benefits for large particle counts (>10k)
- For smaller simulations (<5k particles), Numba backend may be faster due to lower overhead

## Backend Selection

The simulation automatically selects the best available backend:

```python
import sph

# Check available backends
sph.print_backend_info()

# Manually select backend
sph.set_backend('cpu')    # Slowest
sph.set_backend('numba')  # Fast (recommended)
sph.set_backend('gpu')    # Fastest (if working)

# Auto-select based on particle count
sph.auto_select_backend(n_particles=10000)
```

## Testing

Run the backend test:
```bash
python -m sph.test_backends
```

Run the GPU performance benchmark:
```bash
python sph/benchmark_gpu.py
```

## Optimized GPU Features

The GPU backend now includes several advanced optimizations:

1. **JIT-Compiled Kernels**: Core SPH kernels are compiled with `torch.jit.script` for maximum performance
2. **Persistent GPU Memory**: Particle data stays on GPU between frames with `GPUParticleManager`
3. **Batch Operations**: All pairwise interactions computed in parallel
4. **Optimized Neighbor Search**: GPU-accelerated spatial hashing (work in progress)
5. **Fused Operations**: Multiple computations combined to reduce memory bandwidth

### Using GPU Particle Manager

For maximum performance in your simulation:

```python
from sph.physics.gpu_particle_manager import get_gpu_particle_manager

# Get GPU manager (returns None if not using GPU backend)
gpu_manager = get_gpu_particle_manager()

if gpu_manager:
    # Upload initial data
    gpu_manager.upload_to_gpu(particles, n_active)
    
    # Run simulation on GPU
    for step in range(n_steps):
        # Physics computations use GPU data directly
        sph.compute_density(particles, kernel, n_active)
        sph.compute_forces(particles, kernel, n_active)
        
        # Integrate on GPU (no CPU transfer)
        gpu_manager.integrate_on_gpu(n_active, dt)
        
    # Download final results
    gpu_manager.download_from_gpu(particles, n_active)
```

## Recommendations

1. **For most users**: Use the Numba backend. It's fast enough for simulations up to ~50k particles.
2. **For large simulations (>50k particles)**: Consider building CuPy from source if you have RTX 5080.
3. **For RTX 4090 and older**: GPU backend should work with pre-built CuPy.

The Numba backend provides excellent performance without any GPU setup hassles!
