# JAX vs CuPy for SPH Simulation

## Overview

Both JAX and CuPy are GPU-accelerated Python libraries, but they have different design philosophies and strengths.

## JAX

### Pros:
1. **Better RTX 5080 Support**: JAX uses XLA (Accelerated Linear Algebra) compiler which may have better support for newer GPUs
2. **Automatic Differentiation**: Built-in autodiff - useful if we want to do gradient-based optimization or adjoint methods
3. **JIT Compilation**: `@jax.jit` compiles entire functions, not just kernels - can be faster for complex algorithms
4. **Functional Programming**: Encourages pure functions which are easier to test and debug
5. **Better Optimization**: XLA can do advanced optimizations like operation fusion
6. **Unified CPU/GPU Code**: Same code runs on CPU or GPU without changes
7. **Growing Ecosystem**: Becoming standard in ML/scientific computing

### Cons:
1. **Learning Curve**: Functional programming style (no in-place operations)
2. **Memory Overhead**: Creates new arrays instead of modifying in-place
3. **Compilation Time**: First JIT compilation can be slow
4. **Less Direct GPU Control**: Can't write custom CUDA kernels as easily

### Example JAX SPH Code:
```python
import jax
import jax.numpy as jnp
from jax import jit, vmap

@jit
def compute_density_jax(positions, masses, h):
    """Compute SPH density using JAX."""
    # Pairwise distances (vectorized)
    r = jnp.linalg.norm(positions[:, None] - positions[None, :], axis=2)
    
    # Cubic spline kernel
    q = r / h
    W = jnp.where(q <= 1.0, 
                  1 - 1.5*q**2 + 0.75*q**3,
                  jnp.where(q <= 2.0, 0.25*(2-q)**3, 0.0))
    W *= 10/(7*jnp.pi*h**2)  # 2D normalization
    
    # Density summation
    return jnp.sum(masses * W, axis=1)
```

## CuPy

### Pros:
1. **Drop-in NumPy Replacement**: Minimal code changes from NumPy
2. **Direct CUDA Access**: Can write custom CUDA kernels for maximum performance
3. **Memory Control**: In-place operations for memory efficiency
4. **Mature Library**: Well-tested, stable API
5. **Lower Memory Usage**: Can modify arrays in-place
6. **Fine-grained Control**: Direct control over GPU operations

### Cons:
1. **RTX 5080 Issues**: Current pre-built versions don't support sm_120
2. **No Autodiff**: Would need separate library for gradients
3. **Manual Memory Management**: Need to handle GPU memory transfers
4. **Less Optimization**: Doesn't have XLA's advanced optimizations

### Example CuPy SPH Code:
```python
import cupy as cp

# Custom CUDA kernel for performance
density_kernel = cp.RawKernel(r'''
extern "C" __global__
void compute_density(float* density, float* pos_x, float* pos_y, 
                    float* mass, float h, int n) {
    int i = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
    if (i >= n) return;
    
    float sum = 0.0f;
    for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
        float dx = pos_x[i] - pos_x[j];
        float dy = pos_y[i] - pos_y[j];
        float r = sqrtf(dx*dx + dy*dy);
        // Kernel calculation...
        sum += mass[j] * W;
    }
    density[i] = sum;
}
''', 'compute_density')
```

## Recommendation for SPH

### Use JAX if:
- You want the easiest path to RTX 5080 support
- You're comfortable with functional programming
- You might add optimization/learning components later
- You prefer high-level abstractions

### Use CuPy if:
- You need maximum performance with custom CUDA kernels
- You want minimal changes from NumPy code
- Memory efficiency is critical
- You prefer explicit control

## Quick JAX Test for RTX 5080

```bash
# Install JAX with CUDA support
pip install --upgrade "jax[cuda12]"

# Test it
python -c "import jax; print(jax.devices())"
```

## Migration Path

Since our SPH code is already NumPy-based, here's the migration effort:

### To CuPy (easier):
- Replace `import numpy as np` with `import cupy as cp`
- Change `np.` to `cp.`
- Handle GPU memory transfers

### To JAX (more work, better long-term):
- Replace `import numpy as np` with `import jax.numpy as jnp`
- Remove all in-place operations (+=, -=, etc.)
- Add @jit decorators
- Restructure loops to use vmap/scan

## My Recommendation

**For RTX 5080: Try JAX first**. It's more likely to work out-of-the-box with newer GPUs and the functional style, while different, leads to cleaner SPH code. The XLA compiler can also produce very efficient code without manual CUDA kernel writing.

Would you like me to create a JAX version of our SPH physics kernels to test?
