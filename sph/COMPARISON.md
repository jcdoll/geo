# Comparison: Grid-Based vs SPH Approaches

## Overview

This document compares the grid-based (CA and flux) approaches with SPH for our geological simulation project.

## Key Differences

### 1. Spatial Discretization

**Grid-Based (CA/Flux)**:
- Fixed Eulerian grid
- Materials flow through cells
- Resolution limited by grid spacing
- Empty cells still consume memory

**SPH**:
- Lagrangian particles
- Particles move with material
- Resolution adapts to material distribution
- No wasted computation on empty space

### 2. Density Handling

**Grid-Based**:
- Extreme ratios (10^5:1) cause numerical instability
- β = 1/ρ in pressure projection becomes ill-conditioned
- Required complex workarounds (all-speed, Low-Mach preconditioning)
- Still unstable at practical grid sizes

**SPH**:
- Handles 10^6:1 ratios naturally
- No pressure projection needed
- Density computed from particle distribution
- Stable by design

### 3. Material Interfaces

**Grid-Based**:
- Requires volume fraction tracking
- Interface reconstruction needed
- Numerical diffusion at boundaries
- Special treatment for free surfaces

**SPH**:
- Interfaces emerge naturally
- No reconstruction needed
- Sharp interfaces maintained
- Free surfaces automatic

### 4. Rigid Body Behavior

**Grid-Based**:
- Removed rigid bodies for simplicity
- Everything flows (rocks have high viscosity)
- No cohesion or fracture
- Limited geological realism

**SPH**:
- Natural framework for cohesive forces
- Particles can stick together
- Stress-based fracture
- Realistic rock mechanics

### 5. Conservation Properties

**Grid-Based**:
- Cell count conserved (not physical)
- Mass not conserved in phase transitions
- Numerical errors in energy conservation
- Pressure from projection (not physical)

**SPH**:
- Mass exactly conserved (particles have fixed mass)
- Momentum conserved in interactions
- Energy tracked including latent heat
- Pressure from equation of state (physical)

### 6. Computational Efficiency

**Grid-Based**:
- O(N) for most operations
- But N includes empty cells
- Cache-friendly for regular grids
- Pressure solve can be expensive

**SPH**:
- O(N) with spatial hashing
- N only includes actual material
- Less cache-friendly (irregular access)
- No linear system to solve

### 7. Implementation Complexity

**Grid-Based**:
- Complex staggered grid (MAC) for stability
- Multigrid solver for pressure
- Careful treatment of boundaries
- Many special cases

**SPH**:
- Conceptually simpler
- Same equations for all materials
- Unified framework
- Fewer special cases

## Specific Issues Addressed by SPH

### 1. Pressure Instability
- **Problem**: Grid methods failed with space (0.001 kg/m³) vs uranium (19,000 kg/m³)
- **SPH Solution**: No pressure projection, no β = 1/ρ terms, inherently stable

### 2. Material Stiffness
- **Problem**: Rocks behaved as very viscous fluids
- **SPH Solution**: Cohesive bonds create proper solid behavior

### 3. Vacuum Treatment
- **Problem**: Space regions required special handling
- **SPH Solution**: Simply don't place particles in vacuum

### 4. Phase Transitions
- **Problem**: Mass conservation violated during transitions
- **SPH Solution**: Particles change properties but keep mass

## When to Use Each Method

### Grid-Based Strengths:
- Dense fluids with small density variations
- Incompressible flow
- Well-established CFD problems
- Need exact incompressibility

### SPH Strengths:
- Large density variations
- Free surface flows
- Solid mechanics with fracture
- Material mixing and separation
- Astrophysical simulations

## Conclusion

For our geological simulation with requirements of:
- Extreme density ratios (space to uranium)
- Solid-fluid interactions
- Phase transitions
- Self-gravity
- Material fracture and cohesion

SPH is the superior choice. It naturally handles all our requirements without the numerical instabilities that plagued the grid-based approaches.
