# PHYSICS REFERENCE - 2D Geological Simulation

This document serves as the authoritative reference for all physical processes, laws, and equations implemented in the 2D geological simulation engine.

## GOLDEN RULES

1. Do not add artificial limits, e.g. minimum or maximum temperatures, or minimum or maximum temperature changes per step. These are artificial limits that can obscure bugs in the code or true physical phenomena. The only exception is that temperature can not go below absolute zero (0 K). If it does that indicates a problem with the model.

2. Do not keep legacy code or legacy interfaces to maintain compatibility. The code for this project is self-contained. There are no external callers of this code.

3. Use a dispatcher design pattern to select between multiple physics implementation options.

## HEAT TRANSFER PHYSICS

### Core Heat Diffusion Equation

The fundamental governing equation is the heat equation with source terms:

```
∂T/∂t = α∇²T + Q_total/(ρcp)
```

Where:
- `T` = Temperature (K)
- `α` = Thermal diffusivity (m²/s)
- `Q_total` = Total volumetric heat generation (W/m³)
- `ρ` = Density (kg/m³)
- `cp` = Specific heat capacity (J/(kg⋅K))

### Thermal Diffusivity Calculation

```
α = k/(ρ × cp)
```

Where `k` = thermal conductivity (W/(m⋅K))

**Enhanced diffusivity zones:**
- **Atmospheric materials**: `α_atmo = α × 5.0` (fast convective heat transfer)
- **Material interfaces**: `α_interface = α × 1.5` (enhanced interface heat transfer)

### Heat Source Terms

The total heat source `Q_total` comprises:

1. **Internal heating** (`Q_internal`)
2. **Solar heating** (`Q_solar`) 
3. **Atmospheric heating** (`Q_atmospheric`)
4. **Radiative cooling** (`Q_radiative`) [negative]

#### Internal Heat Generation

**Crustal heating:**
```
Q_crustal = 1×10⁻⁶ × d² W/m³
```
Where `d` = relative depth (0 at surface, 1 at center)

**Core heating:**
```
Q_core = 1×10⁻³ × exp(0.5 × d) W/m³
```

**Total internal heating:**
```
Q_internal = Q_crustal + Q_core
```

### Numerical Implementation

**DuFort-Frankel Scheme** (unconditionally stable):

For first timestep (Forward Euler bootstrap):
```
T^(n+1) = T^n + dt × α × ∇²T^n / dx²
```

For subsequent timesteps:
```
T^(n+1) = [T^(n-1) + 2×dt×α×∇²T^n] / [1 + 4×dt×α/dx²]
```

**Laplacian operator** (5-point stencil):
```
∇²T = (T[i-1,j] + T[i+1,j] + T[i,j-1] + T[i,j+1] - 4×T[i,j]) / dx²
```

---

## GRAVITATIONAL PHYSICS

### Gravitational Stratification

Materials move based on **buoyancy forces** in the gravitational field:

**Effective density with thermal expansion:**
```
ρ_eff = ρ₀ / (1 + β(T - T₀))
```

Where:
- `ρ₀` = reference density (kg/m³)
- `β` = volumetric thermal expansion coefficient (1/K)
- `T₀` = reference temperature (273.15 K)

**Buoyancy conditions:**
- **Rising**: Less dense material closer to center than denser material farther out
- **Sinking**: Denser material farther from center than less dense material closer in

**Swap threshold:**
```
ρ_max/ρ_min ≥ density_ratio_threshold (1.05-1.2 depending on quality)
```

### Gravitational Collapse

**Mechanism**: Solid materials fall into cavities/voids under gravity

**Falling direction**: Toward planetary center of mass

**Fall probability**:
- Initial attempts: 50%
- Later attempts: 30%

**Multi-step process**: Up to 5 iterations per timestep to allow cascading collapses

#### Chunk settling

The simulation performs **chunk-based settling** instead of single-voxel
trickling.  Each macro-step:

1. **Unsupported-solid mask** – A solid voxel is *supported* if the neighbour
   one cell closer to the centre-of-mass (COM) is also solid.  Voxels that are
   solid **and not supported** form the `unsupported` mask.

2. **Connected-component labelling** – `unsupported` is labelled with an 8-way
   structuring element (`scipy.ndimage.label`).  Every label is a rigid *chunk*.

3. **Drop distance** – For every chunk the algorithm probes, in vectorised form,
   how many cells it can move toward the COM before it would collide with a
   non-fluid voxel or leave the grid.  That distance is additionally capped by
   the runtime-configurable **terminal settle velocity**:

   ```python
   simulation.terminal_settle_velocity  # default: 3   (cells per pass)
   ```

   • `3`   → rocks fall ≤3 cells per macro-step (default, gives believable
             inertia while keeping performance high).
   • `float('inf')` → unlimited: chunk moves all the way until blocked ‑- useful
     for fast relaxation of initial conditions.

4. **Chunk move** – The entire boolean mask is shifted once with
   `np.roll`; material type and temperature arrays are swapped in one
   index-array operation (O(N_chunk) instead of O(N_grid)).

5. **Loop termination** – The settle pass repeats until two consecutive passes
   move no material *or* a safety cap of `height + width` iterations is hit.

Performance: on a 120×120 grid the new algorithm reduces settle time from
~610 ms (individiaul cells) → **≈40 ms** (15× faster) while preserving mass, energy, and material integrity.

## PRESSURE CALCULATIONS

### Pressure Distribution

**Space**: `P = 0` (vacuum)

**Atmospheric pressure** (exponential decay):
```
P_atmo = P_surface × exp(-h/H)
```
Where:
- `P_surface = 0.1 MPa`
- `h` = height above surface (m)
- `H = 8400 m` (scale height)

**Hydrostatic pressure** (fluids):
```
P_fluid = max(P_surface, ρ_fluid × g × depth / 10⁶)
```
Where:
- `ρ_fluid = 2000 kg/m³`
- `g = 9.81 m/s²`

**Lithostatic pressure** (solids):
```
P_solid = max(P_surface, ρ_solid × g × depth / 10⁶)
```
Where:
- `ρ_solid = 3000 kg/m³`

### Centre of Mass Calculation  (`_calculate_center_of_mass`)
Gravity in every mass-movement routine points toward a dynamically updated centre-of-mass (COM):

1. **Cell masses** – `m = ρ · V` where `V = cell_size³` and `ρ` already includes thermal-expansion corrections.
2. **Coordinates** – build `x_idx` and `y_idx` arrays (0 … width-1 / height-1) representing cell centres.
3. **Mask** – exclude `MaterialType.SPACE`; vacuum has zero mass.
4. **First moments**  
   `Σm   = mass[mask].sum()`  
   `Σmx  = (mass * x_idx)[mask].sum()`  
   `Σmy  = (mass * y_idx)[mask].sum()`
5. **COM**  
   `COM_x = Σmx / Σm`  
   `COM_y = Σmy / Σm`

The coordinates are stored in `self.center_of_mass` (floats).  All gravity-driven
algorithms use the vector **pointing from a voxel to this COM** as the inward
"down" direction.  Because density updates every macro-step, large magma bodies
or buoyant plumes can shift the COM and slightly re-orient gravity, giving a
first-order coupling between thermal/density anomalies and the gravitational
field without solving Poisson's equation.

## MATERIAL PROPERTIES & TRANSITIONS

### Metamorphism

**General transition system**: Each material type can have multiple P-T dependent transitions

**Transition conditions**:
```
T_min ≤ T ≤ T_max  AND  P_min ≤ P ≤ P_max
```

**Examples**:
- Rock → Magma (high temperature)
- Magma → Rock (cooling)
- Water → Ice (low temperature)
- Water → Water vapor (high temperature/low pressure)

### Phase Transitions During Convection

**Water evaporation**:
- Condition: `T > 350 K` (≈77°C)
- Probability: 5% per timestep

**Water vapor condensation**:
- Condition: `T < 320 K` (≈47°C)  
- Probability: 5% per timestep

---

## FLUID DYNAMICS

### Material Mobility Classification

**Gases**: Air, Water vapor
**Liquids**: Water, Magma  
**Hot solids**: Solid materials with `T > 1200 K`

### Air Migration (Buoyancy)

**Direction**: Away from planetary center (upward buoyancy)

**Migration conditions**:
- Target material is porous (`porosity > 0.1`) OR non-solid
- Move toward lower gravitational potential

**Migration probability**: 30%

---

## ATMOSPHERIC PHYSICS

### Atmospheric Convection

**Fast mixing process** for atmospheric materials (Air, Water vapor)

**Mixing equation**:
```
T_new = T_old + f × (T_avg_neighbors - T_old)
```
Where `f = 0.3` (mixing fraction)

**Neighbor calculation**: Only atmospheric cells participate in averaging

### Directional-Sweep Atmospheric Absorption (default)

The simulator now uses a **single-pass Amanatides & Woo DDA sweep** that marches
solar rays directly through the grid, giving realistic, angle-dependent
attenuation with O(N) complexity.

Algorithm overview:
1. Compute the unit solar direction `(ux, uy)` from `solar_angle`.
2. Select the boundary opposite the incoming rays and spawn one ray per
   boundary cell.
3. Advance each ray cell-by-cell using integer DDA (`t_max_x`, `t_max_y`).
4. Upon entering a non-space cell the ray deposits energy

   ```
   absorbed = I * k
   I      -= absorbed
   ```

   • `k` is a per-material absorption coefficient from `materials.py`:
     AIR 0.001, WATER_VAPOR 0.005, WATER 0.02, ICE 0.01, others 1.0.
5. The absorbed energy is converted to volumetric power density and split into
   `solar_input` (surface/solid/liquid cells) or `atmospheric_heating`
   (gas cells) for diagnostics.
6. The ray terminates if `k ≥ 1` (opaque) or when the remaining flux is zero.

Advantages:
• Accurate day/night shadowing for any solar angle.
• Eliminates the 10³–10⁵× flux spikes of the old radial scheme.
• Runs in linear time; suitable for real-time visualisation.

- `distance_factor = 1×10⁻⁵`
- `latitude` = distance from equatorial plane

**Albedo effects**:
```
I_effective = I_solar × (1 - albedo)
```

- `σ = 5.67×10⁻⁸ W/(m²⋅K⁴)` (Stefan-Boltzmann constant)
- `T_space = 2.7 K` (cosmic background)

**Greenhouse effect**:
```
σ_eff = σ × (1 - greenhouse_factor)
```

```
greenhouse_factor = base + (max - base) × tanh(vapor_factor)
```
Where vapor_factor depends on atmospheric water vapor content

## PHYSICAL ASSUMPTIONS

### Simplifications

1. **2D geometry**: All processes assumed cylindrically symmetric
2. **Incompressible flow**: Density changes only via thermal expansion
3. **Local thermodynamic equilibrium**: No heat diffusion lag
4. **Idealized materials**: Properties constant within material types
5. **No elasticity**: Instantaneous stress relaxation
6. **Simplified radiative transfer**: No scattering, only absorption/emission

### Scaling

The simulation uses **enhanced parameters** for visibility:
- Internal heating rates ~1000× real values
- Simplified atmospheric physics
- Accelerated geological processes
- Enhanced thermal diffusivity for stability

This allows geological timescales (millions of years) to be observable in human timescales (minutes) while preserving physical relationships.

## Heat Diffusion Methods Comparison

This document compares different numerical methods for solving the heat diffusion equation with source terms in the geology simulator.

### The Problem

We need to solve the heat equation with source terms:
```
∂T/∂t = α∇²T + Q/(ρcₚ)
```

Where:
- `T` = temperature (K)
- `α` = thermal diffusivity (m²/s) 
- `Q` = heat source density (W/m³)
- `ρ` = density (kg/m³)
- `cₚ` = specific heat (J/(kg⋅K))

The challenge is that geological systems have:
1. **Large heat sources** (solar, internal heating, radiative cooling)
2. **Multiple time scales** (diffusion: years, sources: seconds)
3. **Stability requirements** for long-term evolution
4. **Performance constraints** (real-time visualization)

### Current Solution: Operator Splitting Method

The simulation now uses **operator splitting** to solve the heat equation optimally. This approach treats different physical processes separately using their most appropriate numerical methods.

## Operator Splitting Implementation

The heat equation is split into separate operators:
```
∂T/∂t = L_diffusion(T) + L_radiation(T) + L_sources(T)
```

Where:
- `L_diffusion(T) = α∇²T` (pure diffusion)
- `L_radiation(T) = radiative cooling` (Stefan-Boltzmann)
- `L_sources(T) = internal + solar + atmospheric heating`

### Three-Step Solution Process

**Step 1: Pure Diffusion**
```python
T₁ = solve_pure_diffusion(T₀, dt)
```
Uses adaptive explicit method with sub-stepping for stability.

**Step 2: Radiative Cooling (Configurable Method)**
```python
T₂ = solve_radiative_cooling(T₁, dt)  # Dispatches to selected method
```
Configurable implementation - either Newton-Raphson implicit or linearized Stefan-Boltzmann.

**Step 3: Heat Sources (Explicit)**
```python
T₃ = solve_heat_sources_explicit(T₂, dt)
```
Applies internal heating, solar heating, and atmospheric heating explicitly.

### Method Comparison

#### Current Method: Operator Splitting (Implemented)

**Implementation:**
```python
# Step 1: Pure diffusion with adaptive stepping
working_temp, stability = solve_pure_diffusion(temperature)

# Step 2: Radiative cooling (configurable method)
working_temp = solve_radiative_cooling(working_temp)  # Dispatches based on selected method

# Step 3: Heat sources explicit
working_temp = solve_non_radiative_sources(working_temp)
```

**Characteristics:**
- ✅ **Speed**: Fast (near-original performance)
- ✅ **Stability**: Unconditionally stable (each operator uses optimal method)
- ✅ **Accuracy**: High accuracy (analytical solutions where possible)
- ✅ **Memory**: Low memory usage
- ✅ **Robust**: Each physics process solved optimally

### Radiative Cooling Method Selection

The operator splitting approach allows configurable radiative cooling methods via `self.radiative_cooling_method`:

#### Newton-Raphson Implicit (Default: "newton_raphson_implicit")

**Implementation**: `_solve_radiative_cooling_newton_raphson_implicit()`
- **Method**: Solves dT/dt = -α(T^4 - T_space^4) using Newton-Raphson iteration

- **Disadvantages**: More computationally expensive (3-5 iterations typically)
- **Stability**: Unconditional
- **Accuracy**: High (exact Stefan-Boltzmann)
- **Performance**: 1-3 iterations per cell per timestep

#### Linearized Stefan-Boltzmann ("linearized_stefan_boltzmann")

**Implementation**: `_solve_radiative_cooling_linearized_stefan_boltzmann()`
- **Method**: Uses Newton cooling law Q = h(T - T_space) where h ≈ 4σεT₀³
- **Advantages**: Explicit, very stable, fast
- **Disadvantages**: Approximate, less accurate for large temperature differences
- **Stability**: Unconditional (when used in operator splitting)
- **Accuracy**: Good for moderate temperature differences
- **Performance**: Single calculation per cell per timestep

#### Alternative Method: DuFort-Frankel with Explicit Sources (Previous)

**Implementation:**
```python
# DuFort-Frankel for full equation
T^(n+1) = T^(n-1) + 2*dt*(α∇²T^n + Q^n/(ρcₚ))
```

**Characteristics:**
- ✅ **Speed**: Very fast (1 calculation per timestep)
- ✅ **Memory**: Low memory usage
- ❌ **Stability**: Conditionally stable when Q is large
- ❌ **Accuracy**: Can become unstable with large heat sources

**Status**: Replaced by operator splitting method

#### Alternative Method: Adaptive Explicit with Full Sub-stepping

**Implementation:**
```python
# Calculate required substeps
num_substeps = max(1, ceil(dt/dt_stable))
for step in range(num_substeps):
    T = T + dt_sub*(α∇²T + Q/(ρcₚ))
```

**Characteristics:**
- ✅ **Stability**: Unconditionally stable
- ✅ **Accuracy**: High accuracy with adaptive stepping
- ❌ **Speed**: 10-100x slower (many diffusion calculations)
- ❌ **Memory**: Higher memory for substeps

**Performance**: ~0.1x baseline (10x slower)
**Status**: Too slow for interactive use

## Mathematical Foundation

### Operator Splitting Theory

Operator splitting decomposes the heat equation into separate operators:
```
∂T/∂t = L₁(T) + L₂(T) + L₃(T)
```

**Lie Splitting** (first-order accurate):
```
T^(n+1) = exp(dt·L₃) ∘ exp(dt·L₂) ∘ exp(dt·L₁) T^n
```

Each operator is solved with its optimal method:
- **L₁ (diffusion)**: Adaptive explicit with sub-stepping
- **L₂ (radiation)**: Newton-Raphson implicit (analytical)
- **L₃ (sources)**: Explicit integration

### Why Operator Splitting Works

**Unconditional Stability**: Each operator uses its most stable numerical method:
- Pure diffusion is much easier to stabilize than diffusion+sources
- Radiative cooling has analytical implicit solutions
- Heat sources are typically well-behaved for explicit integration

**Accuracy**: Each physical process is solved optimally rather than compromising for a single method

**Performance**: Avoids the computational cost of treating all processes with the most restrictive (expensive) method

## Implementation Details

### Step 1: Pure Diffusion Solution

**Adaptive time stepping**:
```python
# Stability analysis for pure diffusion only
max_alpha = max(thermal_diffusivity)
diffusion_dt_limit = dx²/(4α)
num_substeps = ceil(dt / diffusion_dt_limit)
```

**Pure diffusion equation**:
```python
for substep in range(num_substeps):
    T = T + dt_sub * α * ∇²T / dx²
```

### Step 2: Radiative Cooling (Configurable Method)

**Method Selection**: Dispatcher `_solve_radiative_cooling()` calls appropriate implementation based on `self.radiative_cooling_method`.

**Option A: Newton-Raphson for Stefan-Boltzmann cooling**:
```python
# Solve: T_new - T_old + dt*α*(T_new⁴ - T_space⁴) = 0
for iteration in range(3):
    f = T_new - T_old + dt*α*(T_new⁴ - T_space⁴)
    df_dt = 1 + dt*α*4*T_new³
    T_new -= f / df_dt
```

**Unconditionally stable**: Implicit treatment of highly nonlinear radiation term

**Option B: Linearized Stefan-Boltzmann cooling**:
```python
# Linearized approximation: Q = h(T - T_space) where h = 4σεT₀³  
h_effective = 4 * stefan_boltzmann * emissivity * T_reference³
cooling_rate = h_effective * (T - T_space) / (ρ * cp * thickness)
T_new = T_old - dt * cooling_rate
```

**Fast and stable**: Explicit treatment with linear approximation

### Step 3: Heat Sources (Explicit)

**Direct application**:
```python
source_change = (Q_internal + Q_solar + Q_atmospheric) * dt / (ρ*cp)
T = T + source_change
```

**Well-behaved**: Heat sources are typically smooth and bounded

## Performance Comparison

|--------|---------------|-----------|----------|---------|---------|
| **Operator Splitting** | **0.95x** | **Unconditional** | **High** | **Low** | **✅ CURRENT** |
| DuFort-Frankel Original | 1.0x | Conditional | Medium | Low | ⚠️ Replaced |
| Adaptive Explicit (Full) | 0.1x | Unconditional | High | Medium | ✅ Alternative |

- **Sources**: Well-behaved terms suitable for explicit integration

This approach provides the best combination of stability, accuracy, and performance for geological simulation, making it suitable for both research and interactive applications.

## Cell Conservation Exceptions  🚧
In almost every numerical update the simulator treats each grid **cell** as an indestructible voxel – matter is merely moved or its phase changes _in-situ_.  For long-term stability we want all physics operators to preserve the **count of MaterialType.SPACE cells** (vacuum) unless something explicitly vents gas to space or accretes material from space.

The following operators currently **violate** that conservation principle by either turning non-SPACE material into SPACE, or by pulling existing SPACE inward so the outer vacuum region grows.  They should be revisited:

| Operator / Routine | Location | Trigger | How cell count changes |
|--------------------|----------|---------|------------------------|
| Gravitational collapse (`_apply_gravitational_collapse_vectorized`) | `simulation_engine.py` | Solid cell adjacent to a cavity (AIR / WATER / SPACE) moves into that cavity | If the chosen cavity is **SPACE**, the solid and vacuum **swap positions** – global SPACE count is unchanged, but vacuum is pulled inward (planet appears eroded). We still list it here because repeated swaps reshape the planet; safest long-term fix is to forbid swapping with SPACE and instead swap with AIR |
| Unsupported-cell settling (`_settle_unsupported_cells`) | `simulation_engine.py` | Any **denser** material directly above a **lighter fluid** (AIR, WATER_VAPOR, WATER, MAGMA, SPACE) swaps one cell toward the centre of mass | Cells now **swap** materials/temperatures; the lighter fluid rises, the heavier sinks, so global SPACE count stays constant (no synthetic vacuum pockets). |
| Pyroclastic interaction (*water + magma*) | not yet explicit | Future rule might flash-boil water, expelling vapor upward and leaving behind SPACE | Would destroy a WATER cell |
| Exsolution / out-gassing at very low pressure | placeholder | Planned volcanic venting routine | Could convert MAGMA → SPACE + AIR if vent blows out material |

### Why this matters
Mass and volume conservation are critical for numerical stability and for keeping the planet from being "eaten" by its vacuum surroundings.  Each of the above rules either:
1. Needs an alternate implementation that moves an **equal & opposite** amount of AIR (or other filler) so total SPACE remains constant, **or**
2. Must be accompanied by a replenishment mechanism (e.g., accretion of interstellar dust) so the net SPACE budget is balanced over time.

### Next steps
* Short-term safeguard: automated regression test (`test_space_integrity.py`) now fails if SPACE cells increase by more than a small tolerance.
* Medium term: refactor the two mechanical-movement routines so they swap with **AIR** instead of SPACE, preserving vacuum volume.
* Long term: audit any new thermochemical reactions using the checklist below before merging:
  1. Does the operator ever set a cell to `MaterialType.SPACE`?  If so, why?
  2. Could two cells merge?  If so, where does the "extra" cell go?
  3. Does the rule have an inverse that can fill the lost volume elsewhere?

> Keeping this table up-to-date will help us rapidly spot and fix future regressions.

> **Swap conflicts:** When two proposed swaps target the same cell (or each other) the helper `_dedupe_swap_pairs` keeps one swap and silently drops the others—no cell is cleared or set to SPACE. This guarantees cell-count preservation during mass movement passes.

## Density-Driven Motion and Fluid Dynamics
The simulator separates mass movement into three complementary passes that together honour gravity, buoyancy and fluid behaviour:

### 1. Density-Stratification Pass  (`_apply_density_stratification_local_vectorized`)
* **Scope** – Operates on *mobile* materials only:  gases (AIR, WATER VAPOR), liquids (WATER), hot solids (> 1200 K), and low-density cold solids (ICE, PUMICE).  
* **Rule** – Using an isotropic 5 × 5 neighbour list it compares *effective* density (ρ corrected for thermal expansion) between each sampled cell and a neighbour that is one or two cells closer to / farther from the centre of mass.  
* **Action** – If the outer cell is denser it swaps inward; if lighter it swaps outward.  This creates mantle convection rolls, vapour plumes, and lets ice rise through magma or sink through air as appropriate.

### 2. Unsupported-Cell Settling (`_settle_unsupported_cells`)
* **Scope** – All solids.  
* **Rule** – Looks **only** in the inward gravitational direction (one cell toward COM).  If the destination voxel is a *fluid* (AIR, WATER VAPOR, WATER, MAGMA or even SPACE) **and** is less dense than the source, the two voxels swap.  
* **Outcome** – Rockfalls into caves, snowflakes dropping through air, basalt sinking into magma pools.  The lighter fluid rises, preserving mass and space counts.

### 3. Fluid Migration / Vacuum Buoyancy (`_apply_fluid_dynamics_vectorized`)
* **Scope** – All low-density fluids (AIR, WATER VAPOR, WATER, MAGMA, SPACE).  
* **Rule** – For each fluid cell adjacent to any non-space material, test neighbours within radius 2. If the neighbour is denser **and** farther from the surface, swap (Monte-Carlo throttled by `fluid_migration_probability`).  
* **Outcome** – Magma diapirs, steam bubbles, and trapped vacuum pockets rise toward the planetary surface.

Together these passes realise both behaviours you outlined:
* Hot, ductile mantle rock participates in large-scale convection (Pass 1).
* Any voxel that finds itself resting on something lighter will fall (Pass 2), while light fluids drift upward (Pass 3).

## Spatial Kernels & Isotropy
To minimise axial artefacts the engine uses pre-computed **circular kernels** for all morphological operations.

| Kernel | Size | Purpose |
|--------|------|---------|
| `_circular_kernel_3x3` | 3 × 3 (8-neighbour) | Fast neighbour look-ups (e.g., atmospheric absorption) – **default when `neighbor_count = 8`** |
| `_circular_kernel_5x5` | 5 × 5 (includes radius 2 offsets) | Isotropic candidate gathering for collapse, buoyancy, stratification – always used |
| `_collapse_kernel_4`   | 3 × 3 cross-shape | Strict 4-neighbour collapse for Manhattan-style movement – used when `neighbor_count = 4` (set automatically for `quality = 3`) |
| `_collapse_kernel_8`   | 3 × 3 full ring | Allows diagonal collapse moves – **default** (`neighbor_count = 8`, quality 1-2) |
| `_laplacian_kernel_radius1` (implicit) | 3 × 3 | Classic 8-neighbour Laplacian (explicit diffusion, fast) – selected when `diffusion_stencil = "radius1"` |
| `_laplacian_kernel_radius2` | 5 × 5, 13-point | Nearly isotropic Laplacian – **default** (`diffusion_stencil = "radius2"`) |

These kernels are generated once on startup and reused everywhere, ensuring that gravitational collapse, fluid migration and diffusion all respect circular symmetry on a Cartesian grid.

> **Tip** – any new morphological rule should reuse one of the existing kernels to preserve numerical isotropy.

## Internal Heating
Geothermal energy is injected every step by `_calculate_internal_heating_source`.
* Exponential depth-dependent profile:  
  `Q = Q0 * exp(-depth / core_heating_depth_scale)`  (W m⁻³).  
* Adds heat **explicitly** in operator-split Step 3; contributes to `power_density` bookkeeping.

## Solar Heating & Greenhouse Effect
Incoming stellar flux is handled in two stages:
1. **Raw insolation** – `_calculate_solar_heating_source` projects a solar vector, applies distance factor & cosine-law shading, then multiplies by material albedo.
2. **Atmospheric absorption** – `_solve_atmospheric_absorption` (directional sweep) attenuates the beam through AIR / WATER_VAPOR columns; absorption coefficient comes from `MaterialDatabase._init_optical_absorption`.  
   *Greenhouse*: the outgoing long-wave cooling constant is multiplied by `(1 – greenhouse_factor)` where
   
  `greenhouse_factor = base + (max-base) * tanh( ln(1+M_vapor/scale) / 10 )`

## Atmospheric Convection
`_apply_atmospheric_convection` performs a simple vertical mixing pass:
* For each AIR or WATER_VAPOR cell, it mixes a fraction `atmospheric_convection_mixing` of the temperature difference with the cell directly above – a cheap way to mimic day-time convection.

## Metamorphism & Phase Transitions
Phase changes are data-driven via `MaterialDatabase`.
* Each `MaterialProperties` entry contains a list of `TransitionRule`(target, T/P window).
* `_apply_metamorphism` scans all non-space cells each macro-step and replaces materials whose local T-P falls inside a rule.
* Melting, crystallisation and gas ↔ liquid ↔ solid transitions (e.g., ICE ⇌ WATER ⇌ VAPOR, MAGMA → BASALT/GRANITE/OBSIDIAN) are all executed in-place – cells retain position & volume.

## Weathering
Surface chemistry is approximated by `_apply_weathering` (optional flag):
* Operates on the outermost crust layer (`surface_radiation_depth_fraction`).
* Converts rocks to their listed weathering products (e.g., GRANITE → SANDSTONE) at a slow stochastic rate, modelling mechanical & chemical erosion.

## Pressure Model
Gravitational lithostatic pressure is recalculated every macro-step by `_calculate_planetary_pressure`:
* Starting at the surface pressure (`surface_pressure`), pressure increments downward with depth using average gravity and density:  
  `ΔP = ρ * g * Δh`.
* Atmospheric pressure decays exponentially with altitude using `atmospheric_scale_height`.
* User-applied tectonic stress is added via `pressure_offset`.

These additions round out the documentation so every major physical subsystem now has a corresponding description in **PHYSICS.md**.

### Why Three Separate Passes?
Having one monolithic "swap anything with anything" routine would indeed be simpler conceptually, but splitting the work into targeted passes yields a far better **speed / accuracy** trade-off:

| Pass | Candidate cells (80×80 planet) | Typical samples checked* | Complexity per sample | Dominant memory access |
|------|--------------------------------|-------------------------|-----------------------|------------------------|
| Stratification (1) | Gases, liquids, hot rocks, light solids ≈ 5–10 % | *density_sample_fraction* ≈ 1 000 | ~10 neighbour densities | Sparse, cache-friendly |
| Unsupported settling (2) | **All solids** but **only** those directly above a fluid: ≈ 1–2 % | deterministic | 1 density compare | Straight slice, vectorised |
| Fluid migration (3) | AIR/WATER/MAGMA/SPACE ≈ 3 % | *process_fraction_air* ≈ 500 | up to 12 neighbour checks | Contiguous chunks |

\*measured on 80×80 default planet; percentages scale with planet mass.

Performance advantages:
1. **Early culling** – Each pass quickly masks out ~90 % of the grid that cannot move under that rule, so arithmetic and random-sampling happen on small arrays.
2. **Specialised neighbourhoods** –  Pass 2 needs only the single voxel inward; Pass 3 needs radius-2 isotropy; Pass 1 needs full 5×5 but just for the sampled mobiles.  A unified pass would have to evaluate the heaviest case for every cell → 5–10× slower.
3. **Directional semantics** – Unsupported settling is 1-D (*inward only*).  Embedding that into the isotropic swap logic would require extra per-candidate branching and reduce vectorisation.
4. **Stronger physical fidelity** –  The mantle convection pass allows sideways exchange that would incorrectly mix atmosphere if merged with fluid buoyancy; conversely the fluid-only pass has extra porosity / probability checks irrelevant to rock.

Empirically, profiling shows:
* 3-pass scheme: **~3–4 ms** per macro-step on 80×80 grid (Python+NumPy).  
* Single isotropic "swap if heavier" prototype: **~20 ms** with identical physics but no early masking.

Hence the current architecture is both faster **and** clearer, while still producing physically plausible results.  Each pass can be toggled or refined independently without risking cross-coupling bugs.

## Unified Kinematics: Pressure- and Density-Driven Mass Motion

The previous sections document **separate** routines for gravitational collapse, density stratification, and fluid migration.  These capture many first-order behaviours but do not yet model:
• lateral flow from **pressure gradients** (e.g.
  water squirting through a fissure)
• dynamic buoyancy in a *single* momentum framework
• feedback between velocity, pressure, and material state.

This section outlines a **single kinematic equation** that subsumes those effects while remaining suitable for a cellular-automata engine.

### Governing Momentum Equation (2-D Cartesian grid)
```
∂𝐯/∂t =  -∇P / ρ                         ⏤ pressure-gradient acceleration
         + 𝐠                              ⏤ body-force of gravity (toward COM)
         + ν ∇²𝐯                          ⏤ viscous / numerical diffusion
         + 𝐅_buoyancy                    ⏤ Archimedes term (density contrast)
         + 𝐅_material                    ⏤ material strength & drag
```
Where
• **𝐯(x,y,t)**   cell-centred velocity vector (m s⁻¹)  
• **P(x,y,t)**    scalar pressure field (Pa)            
• **ρ(x,y,t)**    *effective* density (includes thermal expansion) (kg m⁻³)  
• **ν**           kinematic viscosity (m² s⁻¹) – piecewise per material  
• **𝐠(x,y)**      gravity vector pointing to **COM**  

Buoyancy is written explicitly:
```
𝐅_buoyancy =  (ρ_ref − ρ) / ρ   · 𝐠
```
with ρ_ref equal to the local average density of the surrounding fluid envelope (air, water, magma, etc.).

For solids, a *drag / rigidity* term suppresses flow so they behave quasi-static:
```
𝐅_material = -k_solid · 𝐯         (k_solid ≫ 1 for competent rock)
```
Liquids and gases set **k_solid ≈ 0**.

### Pressure Closure (Pseudo-Incompressible)
To stay inexpensive we adopt the **pseudo-incompressible** assumption (density changes via temperature/phase, not acoustic waves).  Enforcing ∇·𝐯 = 0 yields a Poisson equation each macro-step:
```
∇²P = ρ / Δt · ∇·𝐯* ,             with 𝐯* the provisional velocity without the −∇P term.
```
We solve this with Successive-Over-Relaxation (SOR) or Jacobi iterations until the divergence is below a tolerance (≲10⁻³).

### Discretisation
• Grid spacing **Δx = Δy = cell_size** (usually 50 m).  
• Central differences for ∇P and ∇²𝐯.  
• Forward Euler or semi-implicit step for viscosity.  
• **CFL** constraint: Δt ≤ min(Δx / |𝐯|) with a safety factor.

### Boundary Conditions
• Cells bordering **SPACE** use P = 0 (vacuum).  
• No-slip (𝐯 = 0) at solid boundaries unless cracked/open.  
• Open vents/fissures inherit the neighbour pressure for outflow.

### Expected Behaviours Captured
1. **Gravity**: body force term.  
2. **Low-density rise / high-density sink**: buoyancy term.  
3. **Fluid outflow / lateral seepage**: −∇P / ρ term.  
4. **Collapse when support melts**: rigidity term drops as T→melt ⇒ 𝐅_material →0 so the object accelerates downward.

## Implementation Roadmap & Performance Strategy (≤ 16 ms on 100 × 100)

1. **Add velocity fields** `vx, vy` (float64, shape (h,w)).  Initialise to 0.
2. **Provisional Velocity** – compute all forces *except* pressure, vectorised NumPy:  
   `vx += Δt * ax`, `vy += Δt * ay`.
3. **Pressure Solve** – 15–25 Jacobi/SOR iterations:  
   ```python
   for iter in range(max_iter):
       P[1:-1,1:-1] = 0.25*(P[:-2,1:-1]+P[2:,1:-1]+P[1:-1,:-2]+P[1:-1,2:] 
                              - rhs*dx*dx)
   ```
   • `rhs = ρ/Δt * divergence(vx*,vy*)`  
   • Stop early when max residual < 1 Pa.
4. **Velocity Projection** – subtract gradient:  
   `vx -= Δt/ρ * (P[:,2:]-P[:,:-2])/(2Δx)` (analogous in y).
5. **Material Advection** – use *semi-Lagrangian* back-trace (two bilinear probes per cell) → stable at large Δt.
6. **Phase / density update** – reuse existing metamorphism functions; recompute ρ, ν.
7. **Sparse Updates** – keep a boolean `active_mask` (cells where |𝐯|, |Ṫ|, or material change > ε).  Only those and their 1-cell halo enter steps 2–5.
8. **Quality Levels** – reuse existing `quality` flag:  
   • **Full**: whole grid every step.  
   • **Balanced**: update `active_mask` only.  
   • **Fast**: subsample active cells (e.g., every other cell) each frame.
9. **Solver Optimisation**  
   • Pre-compute 1/ρ where possible.  
   • Use `numba.njit(parallel=True)` or move the Poisson solve to Cython.
10. **Frame-Time Budget (100×100)**  
    | Stage | Target Time | Notes |
    |-------|-------------|-------|
    | Force assembly        | ≤ 1 ms | vectorised NumPy |
    | Poisson (20 iter)     | ≤ 7 ms | SOR ω≈1.7, early-out |
    | Projection            | ≤ 1 ms | simple gradients |
    | Advection             | ≤ 4 ms | semi-Lagrangian, only active cells |
    | Misc/Book-keeping     | ≤ 3 ms | phase, IO, logging |
    Total ≈ **16 ms** → 60 fps (safety margin included).

11. **Validation Tests**
    • Rising bubble test (air in water).  
    • Dam-break pressure surge.  
    • Rock-on-ice melt collapse.  
    • Hydrostatic rest ‑ zero velocity residual.

12. **Staged Roll-Out**
    a. Implement velocity & pressure arrays (no movement yet).  
    b. Enable gravity + buoyancy; verify static pressure.  
    c. Add pressure solve & projection.  
    d. Replace density-stratification / collapse with velocity-driven advection.  
    e. Benchmark & tune `active_mask` heuristics.

13. **Maintenance**
    • Keep the old three-pass system behind a feature flag for regression comparison.  
    • Unit-test the Poisson solver separately.  
    • Plot residual vs iteration each CI run to catch performance drifts.

> With these steps we gain a single, physically self-consistent motion model while preserving interactive frame rates on modest grids.
