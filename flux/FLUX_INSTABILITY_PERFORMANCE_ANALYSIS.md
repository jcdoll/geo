# Performance Analysis of Long-Term Solutions

## 1. Compressible Flow Solver

### Performance Impact
- **Computational Cost**: 2-4x slower than incompressible
- **Memory Usage**: ~20-30% more (additional state variables: energy, sound speed)
- **Timestep**: Can be larger due to better stability, partially offsetting cost

### Implementation Complexity
- High - requires reformulating equations, new boundary conditions
- Need to handle acoustic waves (very fast) vs advection (slow)

### Common Usage
- Standard for aerospace (supersonic flows)
- Less common for geological flows due to low Mach numbers
- Often uses **Low-Mach number approximation** for efficiency

## 2. Implicit Time Integration

### Performance Impact
- **Per-timestep Cost**: 3-10x slower (iterative solver required)
- **Overall Performance**: Often FASTER because timesteps can be 10-100x larger
- **Memory Usage**: 2-3x more (Jacobian matrices, solver workspace)

### Implementation Complexity
- Moderate - can retrofit existing code
- Need good preconditioners for efficiency
- Libraries available (PETSc, Trilinos)

### Common Usage
- **VERY COMMON** for stiff problems
- Industry standard for reservoir simulation
- Used in most production geophysics codes

## 3. Adaptive Mesh Refinement (AMR)

### Performance Impact
- **Best Case**: 10-100x speedup (focusing computation where needed)
- **Worst Case**: 2x slower (overhead of managing hierarchy)
- **Memory**: Variable, typically saves 50-90% for large domains

### Implementation Complexity
- Very high - requires major architectural changes
- Complex data structures, parallel load balancing
- Interpolation between grid levels

### Common Usage
- Common in astrophysics (FLASH, Enzo)
- Increasingly used in geophysics
- Best for problems with localized features

## 4. Regularized Incompressible (Artificial Compressibility)

### Performance Impact
- **Computational Cost**: 1.2-1.5x current solver
- **Timestep**: Slightly smaller due to artificial sound speed
- **Memory**: Minimal increase (one additional field)

### Implementation Complexity
- Low - minimal changes to existing code
- Add one equation: ∂P/∂t + c²∇·u = 0
- Tune artificial sound speed parameter

### Common Usage
- Common intermediate solution
- Used in many CFD codes as stabilization
- Good stepping stone to full compressible

## Recommendations by Use Case

### For Immediate Implementation (1-2 weeks)
**Regularized Incompressible** 
- Easiest to implement
- 20-50% performance penalty
- Solves most stability issues

### For Production Code (1-3 months)
**Implicit Time Integration**
- Best performance/stability trade-off
- Well-established techniques
- Many solver libraries available
- Can handle extreme density ratios

### For Research/Long-term (6+ months)
**AMR with Implicit Integration**
- Best overall performance
- Handles multi-scale physics
- Future-proof architecture

## Industry Standard Approaches

For geological/geophysical flows with variable density:

1. **Most Common**: Semi-implicit or fully implicit time integration
   - Examples: TOUGH2 (geothermal), CMG (reservoir), PFLOTRAN (subsurface)
   - Reason: Stability for stiff problems, large timesteps

2. **High-Performance**: AMR with implicit/semi-implicit
   - Examples: Chombo, BISICLES (ice sheets)
   - Reason: Multi-scale physics efficiency

3. **Specialized**: Low-Mach compressible
   - Examples: Maestro (astrophysics), some combustion codes
   - Reason: When acoustic effects matter

## Specific Recommendation for Your Case

Given:
- Large density ratios (up to 19M:1)
- Need for stability
- Geological timescales (want large timesteps)

**Best Option: Implicit Time Integration**

Reasons:
1. Directly addresses the stiffness problem
2. Allows timesteps based on physics, not numerics
3. Well-proven for similar problems
4. Libraries available (PETSc, Sundials)
5. Standard in geophysics industry

Example pseudo-code:
```python
# Current explicit
v_new = v_old + dt * (gravity + pressure_gradient)

# Implicit (backward Euler)
# Solve: v_new = v_old + dt * (gravity + pressure_gradient(v_new))
# Requires Newton iteration

# Semi-implicit (IMEX)
v_star = v_old + dt * gravity  # Explicit
v_new = solve_pressure_projection(v_star)  # Implicit
```

Performance estimate for your case:
- 3x slower per timestep
- 50-100x larger timesteps possible
- Net speedup: 15-30x
- Stable for ALL density ratios
