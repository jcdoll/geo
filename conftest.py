    On Windows Git checkouts that were created in WSL you often get a `lib64`
    symlink which points to `/usr/lib64`.  The link cannot be resolved from
    Windows, and simply calling `Path.stat()` raises ``OSError(1920)``.

    built-in ``norecursedirs`` filter, so we short-circuit here and tell pytest
    to ignore any path whose ``stat()`` raises *any* ``OSError``.
