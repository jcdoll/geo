"""A different approach: solve for velocity potential or pressure correction.

The fundamental issue with solving ∇²P = ∇·(ρg) is that it doesn't uniquely
determine P in regions where ∇ρ = 0.

Alternative approaches:
1. Solve for velocity potential φ where ∇²φ = -∇·v
2. Use projection method: evolve velocity first, then project
3. Solve for pressure INCREMENT from reference state
